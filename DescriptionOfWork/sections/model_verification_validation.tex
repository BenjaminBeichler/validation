\section{\VV of the Formal Model}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\tbc
To ensure the correctness and consistency of the model and its implementation, the validation and verification has to be performed alongside with the modelling process. Thus these tasks will be performed repeatedly during WP3 and will provide feedback to it.

This task handles the verification and validation of the formal model. This will be accomplished by applying the methods chosen in WP4 Task 1 onto the formal model from WP3 using the tool chain developed in WP3. Depending on the chosen approach and applicable tools a variety of verification methods can be applied like:
\begin{enumerate}
\item proof technique
\item model checking technique
\item Simulation
\end{enumerate}
As the verification and validation is part of the development chain, this task is being applied iteratively in parallel to the development of the formal model in WP3. The feedback given should focus on the consistency and correctness of the model and development process in WP3.
The results of this task are the verification and validation specifications (how to perform the V\&V on the formal model), the basic materials (the actual tests cases, checklists, etc.) and the V\&V report on the formal model.
