%define an abstract here
  This document presents an overview of the safety related evaluation criteria used within the openETCS document structure and based on this derives evaluation criteria for the choice of suitable tools and methods for all safety activities which have to be performed during the openETCS development process. These criteria are based on the safety activities required in D2.6 and the general concept for an openETCS safety process.

\section{Safety Process}

The CENELEC standards define safety as the "freedom from unacceptable level of risk
