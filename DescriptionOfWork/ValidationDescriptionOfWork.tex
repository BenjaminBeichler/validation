This work package will focus on the validation and verification of the model. At the very first beginning the target and requirements of the \VV strategy have to be described, i.e., what should be checked? Depending on the Modelling framework, the modelling language and formalization of the System requirements a strategy in form of a concept has to be defined how the consistency, coherence of the model as well as the coverage of system requirements will be transparently verified. Additionally, it is important to validate the model, i.e., to evidence the equivalence of the model and the ETCS system requirement specification (Subset-026 et al.). In other words the reliability and acceptance of the model has to be generated, e.g. nothing is lost or added or mutated and so on. Additionally, it has to be checked that the code is consistent with the model. The WP is intended to be performed in parallel with the modelling in order to apply the strategy and to generate feedback to the modelling process as well as to measure the quality and maturity of the model.
Beside a subtask will manage the consideration of all relevant safety requirements (e.g. EN 50128/129) in the modelling process.
